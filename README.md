# odin-recipes

This project serves as a basic recipe website using HTML. Consisting of a main index page, this website has links to a few recipes.


## What I learned:
- An introduction to HTML and its relation to CSS and JavaScript
- Git and GitHub basics
- The importance of a good commit message, how to write them, and when to write them

## What I learned to implement in HTML:
- Elements and tags (as well as the relationship between nested elements)
- Boilerplate code & how to add comments
- HTML text (paragraphs, headings, bold/italicized texts, etc)
- Ordered and unordered lists
- Links and images (including anchors and the difference between absolute and relative links)
