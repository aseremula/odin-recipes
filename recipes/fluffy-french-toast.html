        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This fluffy French toast recipe is crisp on the outside, but perfectly soft and tender on the inside. The secret ingredient in this fluffy French toast recipe? All-purpose flour! Flour binds the liquids together, which creates a more traditional batter and helps prevent soggy results.</p>
