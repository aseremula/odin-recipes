        <ul>
            <li>1 pound large elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 medium shallot, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>4 1/2 cups shredded extra-sharp cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan</li>
            <li>1 cup Panko</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class ="recipe-header">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta according to package instructions; drain well.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to broil on high. Arrange an oven rack 6-inches from the broiler. Lightly oil a baking sheet or coat with nonstick spray.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic and shallot, and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk in flour and paprika until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in milk, heavy cream and Dijon until slightly thickened, about 3-4 minutes. If the mixture is too thick, add more milk as needed; season with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat. Stir in 2 1/2 cups cheddar cheese, Parmesan and pasta until well combined; season with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine Panko and remaining 2 cups cheddar cheese.</li>
            <li>Spread pasta mixture into the prepared sheet pan; sprinkle with Panko mixture.</li>
            <li>Place into oven and broil, rotating the sheet pan a few times, until golden brown and crispy, about 5-6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
